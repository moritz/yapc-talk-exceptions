= Examples of Error Reporting (1)
:text

    $ route add default gw 192.168.1.1
    SIOCADDRT: No such process

= What's wrong with that?

 * Usage of obscure acronyms
 * What have processes to do with routes?
 * No explanation what went wrong
 * No explanation why something went wrong
 * No explanation which parameter is to blame
 * Google for the error: several possible reasons

= Examples of Error Reporting (2)
:text

    perl -e 'if (time() { }'
    syntax error at -e line 1, near ") {"
    Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.

= Better

 * Tells you which level the error is on (syntax)
 * Tells you where the error is

= But not yet awesome

  * Does not tell you what the problem is
  * Does not tell you how to fix it
